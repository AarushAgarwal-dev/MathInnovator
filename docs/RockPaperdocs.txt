Explanation of the code:

This code implements a  Rock-Paper-Scissors game with different AI adversaries.

1. Imports and definitions:

random: Used for randomly choosing AI moves.
CHOICES: List containing all possible choices in the game.
AIAdversary: Base class for all AI adversaries.
choose_move: Abstract method that each concrete AI implementation needs to define.

2. AI adversary classes:

RandomAI: Chooses a random move from CHOICES.
PatternMatchingAI:
Stores the opponent's past memory moves.
Identifies the opponent's most frequent move and its counter.
Chooses the counter as its move.
MinimaxAI: (to be implemented)
Uses the minimax algorithm to predict the best move based on possible outcomes.

3. play_game function:

Takes the human player's name and an AI adversary object as input.
Loops until the player chooses to stop playing.
Gets the human's move and validates it.
Gets the AI's move by calling choose_move.
Determines the winner based on the chosen moves.
Prints the results of the round.
Asks the player if they want to play again.

4. main function:

Gets the player's name and desired AI adversary type.
Creates an instance of the chosen AI adversary.
Starts the game by calling play_game.
5. Execution:

The code starts by running the main function.
The user enters their name and chooses an AI difficulty.
The game starts and continues until the user decides to quit.
Overall, this code demonstrates object-oriented programming with inheritance and abstraction to create different AI adversaries with varying levels of difficulty in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
